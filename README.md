# Game-of-Thrones-Character-Quiz-
HTML, CSS, and JS - all used together to create a quiz that tells you which Game of Thrones character you'd most likely be!

I used several different functions and methods to be able to store the information the user puts in, attribute the information in a "point" system, and finally tally up the results and display which character had the most points!
